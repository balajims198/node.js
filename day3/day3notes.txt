⿡ Difference between path.join() and path.resolve()

path.join() → joins path segments to form a relative path.

path.resolve() → resolves path segments into an absolute path.

join() works left to right, resolve() works right to left.

resolve() uses current working directory if no absolute path is found.

⿢ Parse query parameters in Node.js

Use the url module to read query parameters.

url.parse(req.url, true) converts the query string into an object.

Commonly used in servers to get values like ?name=John&age=20.

⿣ Synchronous vs Asynchronous fs methods

Synchronous: Blocks further code execution until file operation completes.

Asynchronous: Non-blocking, uses callback or promises.

Async is faster and better for performance.

Example methods: fs.readFileSync() (sync) vs fs.readFile() (async).

⿤ Why nodemon is used

Automatically restarts the server when code changes.

Speeds up development — no need to restart manually.

Used only in development, not in production.

⿥ Advantages of process module

Gives info and control over the current Node process.

Access environment variables with process.env.

Read command-line arguments with process.argv.

Helps manage program exit, errors, and system data.

⿦ Handling multiple routes with Node’s http module

Use if / else if conditions to check req.url and req.method.

Send different responses for each route (like /, /about, /contact).

For complex routing, use Express.js framework.
